# Full-Stack Techdegree - Project 2
 Data Pagination and Filtering

'In this project, you'll use a common web development technique known as “pagination” to enhance the usability of a web page.'

This project contains a list of student names and information in the data.js file, and displays 9 students at a time, with a paginated list at the bottom for navigating through the students, one page at a time.

Extra Credit: 
- Contains a search function at the top, that can filter the returned student list, by search parameters.
- ShowPage and Pagination functions adapt to the filtered results and act appropriately
- A 'No Results Found' message appears after a search that yields no results.

To-Do (not implemented features):
- A search functionality that allows for the specific sorting of 'Miss', 'Mrs' and 'Mr', without returning false positives when searching 'Mr'.
